## Who Am I?

---

### Education

I am currently in my second year at Université de Technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard. However, I am currently studying at AGH University of Krakow for an Erasmus exchange.

Thanks to this Erasmus program, I now have the basics of Polish. I am also fluent in English and French.

### My Interest in technology

I started programming in 2017 with simple Pygame projects as well as making my own website. Nowadays, my passion projects revolve around C++ and Raylib, though I am learning OpenCV to get a head start in my chosen career in medical imagery.

I tend to prefer programming on UNIX-based systems since the terminal workflow is better on them.

### My Hobbies

Since this website does not only serve as a curriculum vitae, I'll leave a line about my hobbies, as they define who I am in both my personal and professional spaces.

I enjoy a wide variety of activities, from art with music production and DJing, as well as game development, to sports like skateboarding, swimming, and running, not forgetting cultural activities such as language learning.
