### Game development
I am working part time on this Shoot'em Up video game. It is inspired by Death Smiles and has an unique mechanic which
is the cauldron. I won't spoil the game before release but this is what was made in the last dev log.

I am also working on learning enet in order to make my first multiplayer game in c++.

### Web development
I made this website to get a more thorough understanding of Alpine.JS which is used in the website of the student association
of my university, and for which I do a bit of dev work. I am also trying to get comfortable with Django as it is also part
of the stack used for the website.

### Interpreters
I like reading about interpreters and I did make a partial attempt at building my own interpreter in Java following the Crafting
Interpreters book. My goal is to try to make something more interesting in the future probably using Golang.

### Markdown
As you may have noticed, this website's content is entirely generated from markdown. Markdown is truely something a powerful tool
that I don't hesitate to use in many cases. For that purpose, I wrote a [static website generator](https://github.com/ken-soares/pyssgen) a while ago, which I am not using anymore
but would if I had to build a blog hosted on Github Pages.
